### Accomplished Tasks

#### Task 1: Improved the look and feel
The templates and helper functions were adapted so that the messaging window displays usersâ€™ avatars next to their messages.

#### Task 2: Implemented data writing security
Insecure package removed from the application and Meteor methods were implemented to allow the insertion of chat items in the Chats collection.
Insertions/ updates can't be made from console.

#### Task 3: Data reading security implemented
Autopublish package removed from the application and publish and subscribe methods were implemented for Chats collection.
Users are only able to retrieve chats that have their user id in either the user1Id field or the user2Id field.

#### Challange task: Emoticons implemented
Emoticon functionality was implemented, which allows the user to insert graphical emoticons into their message.

#### Extra spec 1: Users are redirected to welcome page, can't see chat page or users list nor create new chats unless logged in
Implemented a welcome page and then, through the router, implemented redirect so that users are redireted to welcome page when they logout.
The redirect works when the users logs out in a chat page or in the users list or even if they try to access a chat page through the URL when logged out.

#### Extra spec 2: Messages are displayed in group
Messages from the same user go in the same panel.
New panel is created when the next message comes from the other user.
