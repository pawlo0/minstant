        <h2>Accomplished Tasks:</h2>
        <div class="col-md-offset-1">
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Task 1: </strong>Improved the look and feel</p>
            <p>The templates and helper functions were adapted so that the messaging window displays usersâ€™ avatars next to their messages.</p><hr>
            <p><strong>Task 2: </strong>Implement data writing security</p>
            <p>Insecure package removed from the application and Meteor methods were implemented to allow the insertion of chat items in the Chats collection.</p>
            <p>Insertions/ updates can't be made from console.</p><hr>
            <p><strong>Task 3: </strong>Data reading security implemented</p>
            <p>Autopublish package removed from the application and publish and subscribe methods were implemented for Chats collection.</p>
            <p>Users are only able to retrieve chats that have their user id in either the user1Id field or the user2Id field.</p><hr>
            <p><strong>Challange task: </strong>Emoticons implemented</p>
            <p>Emoticon functionality was implemented, which allows the user to insert graphical emoticons into their message.</p><hr>
            <p><strong>Extra spec 1: </strong>Users can't see chat page or users list nor create new Chats unless logged in</p>
            <p>Altought having acomplished all tasks, there was a little bug in the app. One could see the available users and select one to chat without being logged in.</p>
            <p>This caused the insertion of new chats in the colletion even though one could not maintain that chat.</p>
            <p>Found this bug when tried to find chats through the console and chats keep coming up, without messages though.</p><hr>
            <p><strong>Extra spec 2: </strong>Users are redirected to welcome page if not logged in</p>
            <p>Implemented a welcome page and then, through the router, implemented redirect so that users are redireted to welcome page when they logout.</p>
            <p>The redirect works when the users logs out in a chat page or in the users list or even if they try to access a chat page through the URL when logged out.</p>
